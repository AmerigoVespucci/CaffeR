# CaffeR
A snapshot of Jeff Donahue's version of Caffe for playing around with some new ideas.

The snapshot was taken a while ago and I have been adding some experiments to my local directory. I created this repo from my directory.

If anybody does come across this repo and feels that the ethical, conventional or legally correct path is to fork the original and then recreate my additions, please let me know.

This repo is pseudo-public in that it is meant for private testing but I have no objection to anybody seeing what I am doing in the unlikely event of anybody finding this repo.
